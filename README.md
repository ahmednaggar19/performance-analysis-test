# performance-analysis-test
This project is a small task to get someone to understand very basic profiling and bottleneck finding techniques.

The goal is to find the bottlenecks in the code. (NOT TO FIX THEM)
The code is simple java code with static methods calling other static methods in the same project or from some jar.
DO NOT observing the referenced jar archive.

To get started:
- Clone the repo
- Open in intellij
- Import a gradle project
- Make sure it compiles and run without errors

You will start with this message when running the ```BottleNeckHunt.main``` method for the first time : ```The code has some bottleneck(s)```

You will be receiving hints in the console depending on how you are approaching the problem.

You should get this message if you find the bottlenecks.
```You got me!```

Or this message if you are close
```You are nearly there! ```
